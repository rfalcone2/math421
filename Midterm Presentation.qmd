## Part 2 Results

-LOS peaks at age 13, with males averaging 11 days and females 8 days, and longer stays result in higher charges.

-Teenagers show high variability in total charges, with the highest charge (~$2,400,000) for a 14-year-old male.

-Rhode Island Hospital is the most popular provider for ages 45â€“50 and has the highest total charges compared to other providers.

## Part 2 Results Contin

-Median age for both sexes is 57, with distinct age peaks for males at 65 and females at 30 and 74.

-Male admissions peak in October, female admissions in January, and LOS trends vary by season (summer for males, fall for females).
