## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` or Quarto (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. 


**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use the Rmd templates of the class slides. 

- You can also use Quarto to create the presentation: *In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> Quarto Presentation...*
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can use `![](image.png){width="60%"}` or follow these below instructions.

    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient. 

Link: https://drive.google.com/open?id=15QNBf6YYKocK2nNIfpKDer58kQnCPNZJ 

**Notice**

- Since this is a large dataset, you could try to run the codes on the smaller dataset, which is a portion of the original dataset before running the codes on the original data.  To create a random subset of the data you could use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# find the number of rows of the data
n = nrow(df)

# subset 1000 rows of the data
df1 = df[sample(1:n, 1000), ]
```


-------

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
df = read_sas('hdd0318cy.sas7bdat')
```

    
3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=18`)

```{r}
df = df %>% 
  filter(yod==18)
```

    
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df = df %>%                    
  select("yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day")
```
 

*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  Also notice that, empty values in the data before writing to csv may turn to NAs later when you re-read the file. 

```{r}
write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')
```


5. What are variables that have missing values?

```{r}
df = read_csv('midterm.csv')

colSums(is.na(df))
```
 
6. Remove all variables with missing values. 

```{r}
df = df %>% 
  select(-"payfix",-"raceethn",-"admtype", -"asource" , 
                      -"preopday" ,-"bwght", 
                      -"ecodub92",-"pt_state",-"diag_adm",-"er_mode",
                     -"obs_hour",-"nicu_day")
```

 
7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?

```{r}
#The month of admission is the variable "moa"
#The month of discharge is the variable "mod"
```


8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?

```{r}
which.max(table(df$moa))
#October admitted the most number of patients
```

```{r}
df %>% 
filter(sex=='1') %>% 
  count(moa)
#October admitted the most number of male patients
```


9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?

```{r}
df %>% 
filter(sex=='2', age<= 19, age>=10) %>% 
  count(moa)
#May had the greatest number of teenage female patients; teenage age range being from 10-19
```


10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October? 

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='2', moa=='10')
which.max(table(df$provider))
#7205-Rhode Island Hospital had the most number of female patients in October
```


11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average? 

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(sex) %>% 
  summarise(mean(age))
#On average male patients are older.
```


12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(moa) %>% 
  summarise(m=mean(age)) %>% 
  arrange(-m)
#January has the oldest patients on average age.
```


13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  summarise(s=sum(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(-s)
#7205-Rhode Island Hospital has the highest total charge
```


14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?

```{r}
df %>% 
  group_by(provider) %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age<=19, age>=10) %>% 
  summarise(s=sum(tot)) %>% 
  arrange(s)
#7214-Women & Infants hospital has the least total charge for teenage males, teenage age ranging from 10-19.
```


15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
df$season <- case_when(df$moa <= 3 ~ 'Winter',
                       df$moa <= 6  ~ 'Spring',
                       df$moa <= 9 ~ 'Summer',
                       TRUE ~ 'Fall')
```

```{r}
df %>% 
    group_by(season) %>% 
    summarise(mlos = mean(los)) %>% 
    arrange(-mlos)

#On average Fall has the longest length of stays.
```


16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?

```{r}
df %>% 
  filter(sex=='1', age == '20', season == 'Fall', los == '1') %>% 
  summarise(avgcharge = mean(tot))
  
#On average, it costs $16,511 for a 20 year old male staying 1 day in the fall season. 
```


17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 

```{r}
  #After going through the data in this section, the results have been very interesting. There are so many variables that coincide and work to put things together. This dataset has had the most amount of variables worked with by far. However, it is interesting that there were some variables that were still needed to be created throughout the section. Given so much data, I think it is interesting to hone down into a specific finding and find results. 
```

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis

```{r}
#PLOT1
library(tidyverse)
df1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex))
g1 = df1 %>% ggplot()+
  geom_smooth(mapping = aes(x=age, y=los, color=sex))+

  labs(x='Length of Stay',
       y='Total Charge',
       title= 'Total Charges VS Length of Stay by Sex',
       caption = 'The data shows that the longer the stay, the higer the charge.')

ggsave(filename = 'plot5.png', plot = g5)
```
```{r}
#PLOT6
df1 <- df %>%

```


```{r}
#PLOT8
df1 <- df %>% 
  mutate(sex = as.factor(sex))
g8 = df1 %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_density(mapping = aes(x=age, colour = sex))+
  labs(x='Age',
       y='Density',
       title ='',
       caption = 'The data shows that within the dataset, there is a vast majority of males that are 65, and for females it peaks at 30 and again around 74.')

ggsave(filename = 'plot10.png', plot = g10)
```


2. Make an animation plot. 

```{r}
library(lubridate)
library(gganimate)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)

df1 = df

df1$month <- month(df1$moa)
d1 <- df1 %>% group_by(month, provider) %>% summarise(mean= mean(tot))
d2 <- d1 %>% group_by(month) %>% mutate(rank= rank(-mean))
d3 <- d2 %>% filter(rank <= 5)

aa = a1 <- d3 %>% ggplot(aes(x=rank, y=mean, group=provider, fill=provider, label=provider))+ geom_col()+
  geom_text(aes(y=mean, label=provider), hjust = 1.4)+
  coord_flip(clip = 'off', expand = FALSE)+scale_x_reverse()+
  labs(title = 'Month {closest_state}', x='', y='Total Charge', fill='Provider')+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 22), axis.ticks.y = element_blank(), axis.text.y = element_blank())+
  transition_states(month)+
  ease_aes('cubic-in-out')

anim = animate(a1, nframes=400)

anim_save("animation.gif", animation = anim)
```


3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

```{r}
#After going through the data and looking at it from a different perspective helped see how large and challenging this dataset is. There are many variables that coincide and after creating plots on the data, it helped show which provider was the most popular and expensive, and that was Rhode Island Hospital. There was also a lot to see with coorelation of length of stay, sex, and age.
```

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 

  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 

```{r}
median(df$tot)
```
```{r}
df$target <- ifelse(df$tot<21854,'low','high')

df <- df %>% 
  mutate(target=as.factor(target))


```


*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
  
```{r}
df1 = df

df1 = df1 %>% select("age", "sex", "provider", "moa", "mod", "campus", "los", "target")
```
  
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 

```{r}

# df1 = df1 %>%  filter(!raceethn=='', !admtype=='')

library(caret)

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df1$target, p=0.10, list = FALSE)

df_train <- df1[splitIndex,]
df_test <- df1[-splitIndex,]
```

2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 

```{r}
library(rpart)

model1 <- train(target~., data = df_train,
                method = "rpart2",
                maxdepth=3)

pred <- predict(model1, df_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)

cm$overall[1]


```
```{r}
plot(varImp(model1))
```


3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 

```{r}
library(caret)

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

forest_ranger <- train(target~., data = df_train,
                       method = "ranger",
                       trControl = trControl)

plot(forest_ranger)
```


```{r}
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

fda <- train(target~., data = df_train,
                        method = "fda",
                        trControl = trControl)

plot(fda)
```


4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 

```{r}
results <- resamples(list('Forest Ranger' = forest_ranger,
                          'FDA' = fda))
bwplot(results)

```


5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 

```{r}
pred <- predict(forest_ranger, df_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)

cm$overall[1]
```


6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 

```{r}
median(df$age)
```


```{r}
#Creating the new Target
df2 = df

df2$target <- ifelse(df2$age<56,'low','high')

df2 <- df2 %>% 
  mutate(target=as.factor(target))

#Selecting the Variables

df2 = df2 %>% select("age", "sex", "provider", "moa", "mod", "campus", "los", "target")
```

```{r}
#1
library(caret)

splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df2$target, p=0.10, list = FALSE)

df_train <- df2[splitIndex,]
df_test <- df2[-splitIndex,]
```

```{r}
#2
library(rpart)

model1 <- train(target~., data = df_train,
                method = "rpart2",
                maxdepth=3)

pred <- predict(model1, df_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)

cm$overall[1]

plot(varImp(model1))

```

```{r}
#3a
library(caret)

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

forest_ranger <- train(target~., data = df_train,
                       method = "ranger",
                       trControl = trControl)

plot(forest_ranger)
```

```{r}
#3b
trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

fda <- train(target~., data = df_train,
                        method = "fda",
                        trControl = trControl)

plot(fda)
```

```{r}
#4
results <- resamples(list('Forest Ranger' = forest_ranger,
                          'FDA' = fda))

bwplot(results)
```

```{r}
#5
pred <- predict(forest_ranger, df_test)
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)

cm$overall[1]
```


7. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

```{r}
#After going through the data and creating decision trees, the data shows that when the total charge was the target variable that it is 79% accurate. However when going through and changing the target to age, the data showed that it is 100% accurate. This can be due to a perfect model or overfitting. 
```
